# 1. Introduction

This document describes the overall architecture of the AZEBAL project, covering backend systems, shared services, and non-UI related aspects. The main goal of this document is to serve as an architectural blueprint for AI-based development, ensuring consistency in selected patterns and technologies.

## 1.1. Starter Template or Existing Project

After reviewing the PRD, AZEBAL is a **completely new (Greenfield) project** built from scratch without any specific starter template. Therefore, all technology stack configurations and project structures will be newly defined in this architecture document.
