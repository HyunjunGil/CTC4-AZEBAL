# 17. Next Steps

**Developer Agent Prompt:**

> The architecture design for the AZEBAL project has been completed with detailed debug_error API specifications. Please begin MVP development based on the attached **PRD v2.0** and **updated architecture document**. 
>
> **Implementation Priority:**
> 1. Start with **Story 1.1** of **Epic 1** (already completed)
> 2. Proceed to **Epic 2** implementation using the detailed API design in section 7.2
> 3. Focus on MVP scope only - defer Post-MVP features to backlog
>
> **Technical Requirements:**
> - Comply with **'Source Tree'**, **'Coding Standards'**, and **'Test Strategy'** sections
> - All code must include 100% type hints
> - Generate comprehensive unit tests using `Pytest`
> - Implement in-memory session management for MVP (no Redis required initially)
> - Follow the exact API schemas and control mechanisms defined in section 7.2
