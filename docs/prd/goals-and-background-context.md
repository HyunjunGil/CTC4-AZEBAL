# 1. Goals and Background Context

### **1.1 Goals**
* **Business Goals**:
    * Reduce redundant resources (time, manpower) spent on resolving Azure-related issues.
    * Systematize and accumulate fragmented problem-solving experiences as sustainable technical assets for the organization.
* **User Goals**:
    * Dramatically reduce the time developers spend debugging and resolving Azure-related errors.
    * Reduce the frequency of consulting colleagues or searching through multiple documents for problem resolution, allowing developers to focus on core tasks.

### **1.2 Background Context**
Currently, KT's Azure developers are wasting unnecessary time and resources due to issues such as lack of expertise, absence of integrated spaces for experience sharing, and inefficient debugging environments. AZEBAL is an MCP server for AI agents that integrates directly into developers' IDEs, providing personalized and immediately applicable solutions by comprehensively analyzing three contexts: user permissions, source code, and real-time Azure resource status. The goal is to transform fragmented problem-solving approaches into organizational systems, thereby raising KT's Azure technical response capabilities to a higher standard.
