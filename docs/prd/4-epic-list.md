# 4. Epic List

AZEBAL MVP development consists of two sequential epics considering technical dependencies and value delivery stages.

* **Epic 1: Security Authentication and Azure Session Foundation**
    * **Goal**: Establish a technical foundation where users can securely authenticate to AZEBAL with their MS account within the IDE, and AZEBAL can successfully call Azure APIs on behalf of users based on this authentication information.

* **Epic 2: Real-time Error Analysis Engine Implementation**
    * **Goal**: Implement the core analysis functionality of the `debug_error` tool that analyzes and resolves actual user errors on the authentication foundation built in Epic 1.
