# 7. Checklist Results Report

**Executive Summary:**
This AZEBAL PRD has **very high overall completeness (Overall Readiness: High)** based on PM checklist review results, with clear MVP scope and specific requirements, making it **Ready** to begin the next step of architecture design. A few minor improvements were identified, but they can be sufficiently discussed and detailed during the architecture design process.

**Category Analysis Table:**

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | ✅ PASS | None |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | ✅ PASS | None |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | N/A | Not applicable as this is a backend service without GUI |
| 4. Functional Requirements | ✅ PASS | None |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Reliability requirements not explicitly specified |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | ✅ PASS | None |
| 7. Technical Guidance | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Need to strengthen detailed rationale and alternatives for major technical decisions |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | ✅ PASS | None |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | ✅ PASS | None |

**Critical Deficiencies:**
* None.

**Recommendations:**
* **Should-fix**: It is recommended to clearly specify concrete requirements for reliability (e.g., failure recovery, retry policies) and detailed rationale and alternative analysis for major technical decisions like adopting monolithic structure in the architecture design phase.

**Final Decision:**
* **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: This PRD contains sufficient information to begin architecture design.
